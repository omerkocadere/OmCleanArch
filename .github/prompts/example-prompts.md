let's create a new prd in markdown about an application that is for pet owners to find and share and rate pet friendly locations. keep it high level and no technical details

---

Based on the PRD below, let's generate a landing page for the application. With the following in mind:

- Let's use a modern style with gradient colors that are in dark pink hues, nice fonts, and plenty of emoji, and have nice hover effects throughout bringing it to live.
- Make sure we have nice headers for navigation and a footer as well with standard links and copyright information.
- The landing page should be responsive and look good on both desktop and mobile devices and work in light and dark modes with a toggle take some time reflect on the design and make it look good, make sure all of the key features are highlighted.
- I have some pet photos in the wwwroot/images/pets and venue images in wwwroot/images/venues that we could use. Update the existing Home.Razor file.
