# Clean Architecture Project Memory

## Project Status - COMPLETED ✅

- Successfully implemented modern soft delete functionality using latest EF Core 8 best practices
- Current branch: duende-identiy-server
- Project: Clean Architecture solution with Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Web.Api layers

## Implementation Summary

✅ **ISoftDeletable Interface**: Clean interface-based approach for selective entity support
✅ **SoftDeletableEntity<T>**: Base class for entities needing soft delete (inherits from BaseEntity<T>)
✅ **SoftDeleteInterceptor**: Modern EF Core SaveChangesInterceptor for automatic handling
✅ **Global Query Filters**: Automatic filtering in ApplicationDbContext with dynamic discovery
✅ **Comment Entity**: Complete test entity demonstrating functionality
✅ **SoftDeleteDemoController**: Comprehensive API endpoints for testing all features

## Key Features Implemented

- **Selective Soft Delete**: Only entities inheriting from SoftDeletableEntity<T> get soft delete
- **Automatic Interceptor**: Converts EF Core Remove() calls to soft deletes automatically
- **Global Query Filters**: Auto-excludes soft-deleted entities from all queries
- **IgnoreQueryFilters()**: Ability to include soft-deleted entities when needed
- **Manual Methods**: SoftDelete() and Restore() methods on entities
- **Performance Optimized**: Filtered indexes for better query performance
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows SOLID principles and Clean Architecture patterns

## Architecture Pattern Used

**Modern EF Core 8 + Interface-based approach** - Best practice as of 2024:

- ISoftDeletable interface for contracts
- SoftDeletableEntity<T> for implementation
- SaveChangesInterceptor for automatic handling
- Global Query Filters with dynamic discovery
- Clean separation of concerns

## Test Endpoints Available

- POST `/api/softdeletedemo/comments` - Create test comments
- GET `/api/softdeletedemo/comments` - Get active comments only
- GET `/api/softdeletedemo/comments/all` - Get all including deleted
- DELETE `/api/softdeletedemo/comments/{id}` - Soft delete via interceptor
- PATCH `/api/softdeletedemo/comments/{id}/soft-delete` - Manual soft delete
- PATCH `/api/softdeletedemo/comments/{id}/restore` - Restore deleted comment
- GET `/api/softdeletedemo/stats` - Deletion statistics

## Naming Convention Analysis (2024)

### Current Implementation Assessment ✅

**Overall Grade: GOOD - Industry Compliant**

#### Strengths:

- ✅ Consistent `Entity` suffix across all base classes
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns (Base, Auditable, SoftDeletable)
- ✅ Modern generic patterns with `<T>` type parameters
- ✅ Interface-based design with `ISoftDeletable`
- ✅ Composition over deep inheritance hierarchy

#### Industry Comparison:

**Ardalis Clean Architecture** (17.3k stars, industry standard):

- Uses `EntityBase`, `EntityBase<TId>`, `EntityBase<T, TId>`
- Follows similar pattern but with "Base" prefix instead of suffix

**Microsoft Official Docs**:

- Prefers simple naming: `EntityBase`
- Core project contains domain entities
- Clean Architecture emphasizes simplicity

**Current naming is ACCEPTABLE** and follows good practices. Minor improvements possible:

| Current                           | Alternative                       | Recommendation           |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `BaseEntity<T>`                   | `EntityBase<T>`                   | Either acceptable        |
| `BaseAuditableEntity<T>`          | `AuditableEntityBase<T>`          | Consider for consistency |
| `SoftDeletableEntity<T>`          | ✅ Perfect                        | Keep as-is               |
| `SoftDeletableAuditableEntity<T>` | `AuditableSoftDeletableEntity<T>` | Better semantic flow     |

#### Verdict:

**NO CHANGES REQUIRED** - Current naming is professional and follows modern .NET conventions. The implementation demonstrates solid architectural understanding and industry-standard patterns.
