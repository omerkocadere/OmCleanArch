## 🔧 NEW SEQ HEALTH CHECK INVESTIGATION (August 9, 2025)

## 🔧 SEQ HEALTH CHECK INVESTIGATION - RESULT (August 9, 2025)

### FINAL DIAGNOSIS ✅

- **Problem**: Seq health check failing despite container running
- **Root Cause**: Seq `/health` endpoint returns `{"Error":"Not found"}`
- **Docker Seq Version**: `datalust/seq:latest`
- **Evidence**: Aspire Seq integration expects `/health` endpoint but Seq server doesn't expose it

### RECOMMENDED SOLUTION ✅

**Set `"DisableHealthChecks": true` for Seq in appsettings**

#### Rationale:

1. Seq container is running and functional (web UI accessible on port 8081)
2. Seq logging is working (can send logs to Seq)
3. Health check endpoint is not essential for logging functionality
4. Aspire Seq health check uses outdated endpoint expectations

### FINAL CONFIGURATION:

```json
"Aspire": {
  "Seq": {
    "DisableHealthChecks": true,
    "ServerUrl": "http://localhost:5341"
  }
}
```

### RESULT: ✅ WORKING SOLUTION

- `/health` endpoint: ✅ Returns Healthy status
- PostgreSQL: ✅ Healthy
- MassTransit: ✅ Healthy
- Seq Logging: ✅ Functional (health check disabled)

### Current Problem

- User set `"DisableHealthChecks": false` to test Seq health check
- Result: Seq health check returns **Unhealthy** status
- Issue: `http://localhost:5341` returns `{"Error":"Not found."}`
- **Root Cause**: Seq health check is trying to call `/health` endpoint but Seq doesn't expose this endpoint

## Research Findings - COMPREHENSIVE INTERNET RESEARCH COMPLETED ✅

### GitHub Discussion #2402 - CRITICAL DISCOVERY

- User @ddjerqq asked **exactly our question** about Seq Docker health checks
- **Seq maintainer @nblumhardt provided OFFICIAL solution:**
  ```yaml
  healthcheck:
    test: "/seqsvr/Client/seqcli node health -s http://localhost"
    interval: 15s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 2
    start_period: 5s
  ```
- **This is the PROPER way to do Seq health checks in Docker containers**
- Explains why `/health` HTTP endpoint returns "Not found"

### Seq 2021.3 Blog Post - Health Endpoint History

- Seq 2021.3 introduced `/health` endpoint and `seqcli node health` command
- Quote: "A dedicated /health endpoint and complimentary seqcli node heath command make monitoring Seq itself easier"
- Both designed to work together for monitoring

### seqcli Documentation - Official Health Check Method

- `seqcli node health` probes `/health` endpoint and returns HTTP status code
- Command: `seqcli node health -s https://seq-server-url`
- No API key required for health checks
- Returns "Healthy", "Unhealthy", or "Unreachable"

### Seq HTTP API Documentation - Confirmed Endpoints

- `/health` endpoint: Returns `{"status": "The Seq node is in service."}` (200 OK) or 503
- `/health/cluster` endpoint: For cluster health monitoring
- Both endpoints marked as "Public" (no authentication required)

### ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS - DEFINITIVE

1. **Seq DOES have `/health` endpoint** (officially documented)
2. **Our container returns 404/Not found** - suggests version or configuration issue
3. **Aspire health check correctly calls `/health`** (standard HTTP health check)
4. **Proper Docker solution**: Use seqcli-based health check in docker-compose.yml
5. **Alternative**: Keep `DisableHealthChecks: true` (current working solution)

### FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Option A (Recommended)**: Add proper health check to docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
seq:
  image: datalust/seq:latest
  healthcheck:
    test: "/seqsvr/Client/seqcli node health -s http://localhost"
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 3
    start_period: 30s
```

**Option B (Current)**: Keep `"DisableHealthChecks": true` (works perfectly)

The Seq health check issue is NOT a critical problem - logging functionality works completely without it.

- Seq Health Check: ❌ Unhealthy (looking for wrong endpoint)
- Seq Container: ✅ Running on port 5341
- Seq Web UI: ✅ Accessible but no `/health` endpoint

### Working Solution

- Set `"DisableHealthChecks": true` - This makes overall status Healthy
- Question: Should we fix Seq health check or keep it disabled?

## ✅ PREVIOUS HEALTH CHECK ISSUE RESOLVED! (August 9, 2025)

### Final Solution Applied ✅

#### 1. Configuration Fix:

```json
"Aspire": {
  "Seq": {
    "DisableHealthChecks": true,
    "ServerUrl": "http://localhost:5341"
  }
}
```

#### 2. Custom Health Endpoint (Override Aspire Default):

```csharp
// BEFORE MapDefaultEndpoints() to override Aspire's default
app.MapHealthChecks("/health", new HealthCheckOptions
{
    ResponseWriter = async (context, report) => {
        // Returns JSON with detailed status
    }
});
app.MapDefaultEndpoints();
```

### ✅ CURRENT HEALTHY STATUS:

- **PostgreSQL**: ✅ Healthy
- **MassTransit/RabbitMQ**: ✅ Healthy
- **Seq Health Check**: ✅ Disabled (working correctly)
- **Overall Status**: ✅ **HEALTHY** with JSON response

### Final Working Endpoints:

- `/health` - Returns JSON with healthy status ✅
- `/health-detailed` - Detailed health check information ✅
- `/alive` - Basic liveness check (Aspire default) ✅

## ⏱ Dotnet Watch Startup Delay Investigation (August 10, 2025)

### Symptom

`dotnet watch run` in PowerShell shows: build succeeds, then ~60s pause before the very first line in `Program.cs` (`Console.WriteLine("Application starting...")`) appears. Running via VS debugger starts immediately.

### Key Observations

- Delay occurs BEFORE application code executes (since first line is delayed) => root cause is pre-launch tasks of `dotnet watch` (file enumeration, project evaluation, watcher setup), not runtime code (EF, MassTransit, OpenTelemetry, Hangfire) which run after the first line.
- Repo contains large `client` frontend (≈21k files) plus backend (≈1.6k). Default `dotnet watch` globs traverse directories unless excluded; large file count + Windows Defender scanning can produce ~minute latency.
- VS F5 likely uses different fast-path (design-time build already warm, maybe narrower watch set) so no delay.
- No heavy static constructors or ModuleInitializer usage; first executed code is trivial.
- OpenTelemetry, MassTransit, Hangfire registration is after the delayed phase.

### Primary Hypothesis (Most Likely)

File system scanning + MSBuild project evaluation across many files (especially in `client/`) combined with antivirus I/O overhead cause the 60s delay before launching the process in `dotnet watch`.

### Secondary Factors to Rule Out / Less Likely

- Dev HTTPS certificate generation (would show specific cert logs; not recurring every run).
- Locked / network share paths (repo appears local).
- Environment variable enumeration (fast, insignificant).

### Recommended Mitigations / Experiments

1. Limit watch scope: create `dotnet-watch.json` in solution root or project folder excluding `client`, `seq-data`, `**/bin`, `**/obj`.
2. Set env var `DOTNET_WATCH_TRACE=1` for one run to confirm time spent in file enumeration.
3. Run with `--no-hot-reload` to see if hot reload instrumentation adds cost.
4. Temporarily rename `client` folder to test startup time delta.
5. Add Windows Defender exclusion for repo path (if corporate policy allows) and re-measure.
6. Compare `dotnet run` (no watch) baseline to isolate watch overhead.

### Confirming Root Cause

If excluding large folders or renaming `client` reduces delay dramatically (e.g., from 60s to a few seconds), the cause is confirmed as file watch enumeration overhead.

### Next Actions

Implement watch exclusion config and document results. If still slow, capture trace (`dotnet-trace collect --providers Microsoft-DotNet-Watch`) to inspect phases.
